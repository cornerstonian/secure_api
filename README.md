For this project, you will be building a Rails-based application which serves up only an API. This API will be responding with JSON and will be secured against unauthorized access.

Deliverables

Link to a GitHub repo
Rails 4.2 application
Including the test runner script (unmodified)
Models:

User username:string password_digest:string
Post title:string
Normal Mode

Create a Rails app that allows a client to list all Posts via an API.

GET /api/posts to return all posts
GET /api/posts/:id gives details of a post
POST /api/posts creates a post
PUT /api/posts/:id updates a post
PATCH /api/posts/:id updates a post
DELETE /api/posts/:id deletes a post
However, this API will follow standard conventions, meaning:

It is secured with an OAuth Password Grant (https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper)
So, you need to post credentials to /oauth/token with username, password, and "grant_type: 'password'" to get an access token.
Access Tokens will then be supplied as Authorization Headers: Authorization: Bearer #{token}
The JSON returned will be customized with JBuilder and will look like the following
/api/posts


{
  posts: [
    {"id": 2, "title": "Yolo"},
    {"id": 3, "title": "Bolo"},
  ]
}
/api/post

{
  post: {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Yolo"
  }
}
To test your API, run the api_runner.rb by running ruby api-runner.rb while your rails app is running. It should output the following. If it doesn't, something is wrong with your code.

Should have 401 if I request api/posts
Creating a User
Creating an oauth token to user
Found 0 posts
Created post with id: $id
Setting title to Macbook
Title is now MacBook
Deleting...
Found 0 posts
Deleting the user to clean up



Difficult Mode:
Add Comments to the API, returning a nested comment list when I ask for /api/posts/4.
Add the ability to add comments by posting to /api/posts/4/comments

Epic Mode: To the homepage, add a JavaScript script that will allow the browser to sign up, and sign in
Enhance the posts to have a content:text and seed with several long posts
When you load the page, use JavaScript (jQuery or equivalent [fetch]) to request from /api/posts and load them on the page, displaying their time to read.
